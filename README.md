# Hi, I'm Colin Westwater

I'm a Senior Infrastructure Engineer located in Paisley, Scotland. I primarily look after the VMware and Windows infrastructure where I work.

I'm a [vExpert PRO](https://vexpert.vmware.com/directory/978) and have various certifications in VMware and Microsoft technologies.

I blog at [vGemba.net](https://www.vgemba.net) and I tweet at [@cwestwater](https://twitter.com/cwestwater)
